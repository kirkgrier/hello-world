<title>St. Andrew's Demo and Test Site Links</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>This page links to the varions staging servers created by SiteGround as we develop and test changes to:</p>
<p><a href="https://standrewspcusa.org/">https://standrewspcusa.org</a></p>
<p>Typically I will update the followling links to the correct server, though I need to do this manually, so if a link is not working, you can check the direct &quot;stagingxx&quot; links that follow. If a server is up, you will be connected to it. The URL in the browser status bar will change to reflect the server you are connected to. As of 1/25/2022</p>
<p>The DEMO site is https://staging2.standrewspcusa.org/</p>
<p>The TEST site is https://staging2.standrewspcusa.org/</p>
